# Incorrect Label Association in HTML Form

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error related to associating labels with form elements, specifically a checkbox nested within a div. The issue arises from the label being a sibling of the checkbox, rather than a direct parent or ancestor. This can lead to unpredictable behavior across different browsers and assistive technologies.

## Bug Description

The primary problem is the incorrect placement of the label element for the checkbox.  Although many browsers handle this seemingly correctly, it is not semantically valid according to HTML specifications and can lead to accessibility issues.

## Solution

A simple fix involves restructuring the HTML to ensure the label is a direct parent of the checkbox.  This guarantees proper association and consistent functionality.
